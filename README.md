# Relational-Database_Case-Study_GPay

## Abstract
This is a case study project on Google Pay, a leading global digital payment platform. 
This project aims to explain the concept of schema design and relationships between entities in relational databases.
This case study is a product dissection of the Google Pay platform. The project covers a company overview of Google Pay, real world challenges related to digital payments faced by users globally and Google Pay’s solutions to those, top features of the Google Pay platform, a high level schema design of Google Pay based on its top features, the relationships between different entities identified in the schema design, an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) based on the schema design and relationships and finally the conclusion.

## Introduction
Google Pay is revolutionizing the world of digital payments through its innovative features and product offerings.
This project covers a detailed product dissection of Google Pay. This information is then used to form a schema design and create an Entity Relationship Diagram which is the most important requirement in the creation of a relational database.

## Problem Statement
1.	What are the real world challenges faced by users in making payments and how does Google Pay address those challenges?
2.	What is the schema design of Google Pay based on the entities and relationships identified from the top features of the platform?
3.	Based on the schema design, create an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) to explain the complexities of integrity and associations in relational databases.

## Approach and Methodology
This case study is divided into the following sections:
1.	Company Overview: This covers a brief history about Google Pay as a company and a digital payment platform and some of its most important and popular features.
2.	Detailed Product Dissection: This covers the real world challenges faced by users in making payments and how Google Pays’ innovative solutions are helping to address these issues. The major problems covered here are:
a.	Physical modes of payment
b.	Repetitive payment information
c.	Traditional methods of money transfer
d.	Physical loyalty cards and tracking of rewards and offers
e.	Inadequate security in digital transactions
f.	Traditional methods of international money transfers
g.	Manual processes of bill payments
3.	Top Features: This covers the top features of the Google Pay Platform.
4.	Schema Description: This section covers a high level schema design of Google Pay based on its top features. The entities identified here include:
a.	User Entity
b.	Payment Methods Entity
c.	Transactions Entity
d.	Loyalty Cards Entity
e.	Loyalty Programs Entity
f.	Merchants Entity
g.	Offers Entity
This section also covers the relationships between all these entities which is a part of the schema design and description.
5.	Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD): This section displays the ERD that vividly portrays the relationships and attributes of the entities within the Google Pay schema.
6.	Conclusion: This is the final conclusion of the Google Pay Case Study Project.

## Contributions
This project is created by using information available on the Google Pay website and the Google Pay App. The ER Diagram is created using an online tool called Lucidchart.

## Challenges
The major challenges faced were on setting up the schema design. Focussing on its top features and understanding how the features are interconnected helped in identifying the main entities and the relationships between them.

## Conclusion
A detailed product dissection of the Google Pay platform helped to identify how Google Pays’ innovative features and product offerings are helping to solve the real world challenges in the era of digital payments. This in turn helped in identifying the top features, crafting a schema design and creating an ER Diagram for its relational database management system.
